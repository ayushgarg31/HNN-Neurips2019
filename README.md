## Reproducing the Hamiltonian Neural Network paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01563


1. Hamiltonian_passed_experiments.ipynb - Containes implementations of all the systems except the Pixels Pendulum System
2. Pixel_Pendulum.ipynb - Contains the implementation of the Pixel Pendulum System
3. Real_mass_spring.ipynb - Contains the implementation of a Real Mass Spring system. This is an original implementation. Not done in the original paper.
