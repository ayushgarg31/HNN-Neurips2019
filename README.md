## Description   
This repository contains Tensorflow code to replicate the experiments given in NeurIPS 2019 paper 

[___"Hamiltonian Neural Networks"___](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01563)

This repository contains the Tensorflow implementation to replicate the experiments given in NeurIPS 2019 paper

1. Hamiltonian_passed_experiments.ipynb - Containes implementations of all the systems except the Pixels Pendulum System
2. Pixel_Pendulum.ipynb - Contains the implementation of the Pixel Pendulum System
3. Real_mass_spring.ipynb - Contains the implementation of a Real Mass Spring system. This is an original implementation which is not covered in the paper. 

## Data for Pendulum HNN
The data used for the Pendulum HNN can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z4pLdDRVspL74JavzXZAoLdI5QSauj8U?usp=sharing)
